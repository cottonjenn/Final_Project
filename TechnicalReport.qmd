## Executive Summary

Overall for this project, we wanted to see if there was a connection between a baseball player's salary and their on-field performance. We found that there was a connection overall, that as their salary went up their perfomance seemed to go up, overall. While it is imporatnt for teams to thoroughly evaluate each decision they make about which players to sign, overall offering a large contract to a star palyer does not seem to diminish their play. As players get paid more, their perfomrance genreally tends to trend upward.

## Project Context

_TODO: Describe the motivation, stakeholders, and success criteria for this analysis._
The motivation behind this was the idea that certian mlb players seem to deteriorate in on-field perfoermace after signing a large free agent contract. We suspected that when players are given enormous sums of money to play, they could develop a sense of security and feel less of a necessity to perform to their whole abilities. These findings could be valuable to major league baseball teams, who could alter their strategies in recruiting and signing free agent players so their teams can play to their full potential. Success criteria for this analysis would be making a significant discovery about this through analysing the data, and in our case gaining sufficient evidence proving our suspicion about player performance and salaries.
## Data Sources
All data we collected were from various sections of the site, baseball-reference.com.
- _Primary dataset:_ `TODO - name and link`
We collected data from the hitter datasets in baseball reference for each year 2018-2025. This was combined with scraped salary data in other sections of the site for our overall dataset.
- _Supplementary data:_ `TODO - describe any external references`
- _Data access notes:_ `TODO - mention licenses or refresh cadence`
Baseball-reference allows this according to their robots.txt.
## Methodology

1. _Data acquisition:_ `TODO - outline collection scripts/APIs`
We collected data from the hitter datasets in baseball reference for each year 2018-2025. We filtered so only players with 100+ Palte Appearances appeared in the datasets.
Salary Data was not available in a large dataset, so we had to build a scraper to loop through each player's individual page and scrape the salary data, creatign a dataset with just the salary data. We combined these datasets to create our overall dataset for hitters' statistics and salaries.
2. _Cleaning pipeline:_ `TODO - summarize transformations and validations implemented`
3. _Analysis workflow:_ `TODO - describe statistical or modeling techniques`
4. _Tooling:_ `TODO - list packages, environments, and reproducibility steps`

## Results & Diagnostics

_TODO: Summarize the main metrics, charts, or model diagnostics produced. Include links to figures or tables once available._

### Summary Statistics and Descriptive Analysis

Our analysis examined 1,985 player-seasons across 300 MLB players from 2018-2025, identifying 495 instances of "big contracts" defined as salary increases exceeding 50% or $5 million year-over-year. Descriptive statistics revealed an apparent performance decline following contract signings, with mean OPS decreasing from 0.765 to 0.745 (Δ = -0.020) and mean WAR declining from 2.113 to 1.872 (Δ = -0.241). Figure 1 displays the average performance trajectory around contract signing , while Figure 2 presents box plot comparisons of pre- and post-contract distributions.

### Mixed Effects Model Results

To account for player-specific baseline performance and temporal trends, we implemented mixed linear models with random intercepts for each player. Model 2, which focused on players within three years of contract signing (N=1,395 observations, 253 players), revealed that after controlling for age and temporal trends, the post-contract coefficient was non-significant (β = 0.011, p = 0.113, 95% CI: [-0.003, 0.025]). Critically, the age coefficient was negative and statistically significant (β = -0.004, p = 0.010), confirming that natural aging, not contract status, drives performance decline. 

Players typically sign their largest contracts between ages 28-31 (see `Figure 3`), coinciding with the onset of natural performance decline.

Among the 253 players analyzed, 59.3% experienced performance declines after their contracts while 40.7% improved, indicating substantial individual variation. Age-stratified analysis showed older players (30+) had the largest descriptive decline (Δ = -0.036 OPS), while younger players (<27) showed minimal change (Δ = -0.001 OPS). However, the interaction between post-contract status and age group was not statistically significant (p = 0.157), confirming that age itself—not the interaction with contract status—drives performance changes (see `Figure 4`).

### Model Diagnostics

Model convergence was achieved with a log-likelihood of 1332.49. The variance components indicate substantial between-player variation (Group Var = 0.003), justifying the mixed effects approach over standard linear regression. The model achieved an R² of 0.66, with player fixed effects explaining the majority of performance variance (F = 7.23, p < 0.001). Notably, temporal analysis revealed no evidence of progressive decline in years following contract signing (years_post coefficient = 0.002, p = 0.610), contradicting the hypothesis that players become increasingly complacent over time.

## Discussion & Next Steps

_TODO: Interpret the results, note limitations, and capture open questions or future experiments._

### Interpretation of Results

Our analysis reveals a notable discrepancy between descriptive statistics and model-based inference. While descriptive comparisons suggested contracts negatively impacted performance, the mixed effects model controlling for player-specific effects, age, and time trends found no statistically significant contract effect. This indicates that the observed descriptive decline is not causally related to contract signing itself, but rather reflects confounding factors that coincide with the timing of major contract negotiations.

The key insight is that the apparent performance decline following large contracts is primarily explained by natural aging patterns rather than any motivational or behavioral change induced by financial security. Players typically sign their largest contracts between ages 28-31, right when natural performance decline begins. The significant age coefficient (p = 0.010) combined with the non-significant contract coefficient (p = 0.113) demonstrates that age—not contract status—drives the observed performance changes. This suggests high-profile cases like Anthony Rendon's post-contract decline represent outliers reflecting injury issues or player-specific circumstances rather than systematic motivational effects.

### Limitations

Several limitations warrant consideration. First, our definition of "big contracts" (50% salary increase or $5M jump) may not capture all meaningful contract events, particularly for already highly-paid players. Second, we lack data on contract length, guaranteed money, and performance incentives, which may moderate the relationship between contracts and performance. Third, injury data was not systematically included; injuries could confound the relationship between age and performance. Fourth, our analysis period (2018-2025) may not capture longer-term career trajectories, particularly for players who signed contracts at the end of this window.

Additionally, survivor bias may affect our results—players who receive large contracts are already elite performers, potentially making them less susceptible to motivational decline. We also cannot fully disentangle regression to the mean from true performance changes, as players often sign contracts immediately following career-best seasons. Finally, our age control uses a linear specification, though performance decline may be non-linear (though our age-squared model showed similar results).

### Future Research Directions

Several avenues for future research emerge from this analysis:

- **Contract structure analysis**: Examine how contract length, guaranteed money, and incentive clauses affect post-contract performance
- **Injury integration**: Incorporate detailed injury data to better separate age-related decline from injury-related decline
- **Position-specific effects**: Investigate whether contract effects differ by position (e.g., pitchers vs. hitters, or by defensive position)
- **Team context**: Analyze whether team quality, market size, or competitive pressure moderates contract effects
- **Comparison to other sports**: Extend this methodology to NBA, NFL, or NHL data to test generalizability
- **Non-linear aging models**: Implement spline or polynomial age terms to better capture performance curve shapes
- **Causal inference approaches**: Apply propensity score matching or instrumental variables to strengthen causal claims

These extensions would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between compensation, motivation, and athletic performance in professional sports.
